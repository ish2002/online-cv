    summary: |
      Hello there :) I am a first-year student at Imperial College London, United Kingdom,
      pursuing a M.Eng in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning).
      I was born and brought-up in Bangalore, India. I take keen interest in Mathematics and Computer Science
      and have been consistently scoring well in the same. I currently possess knowledge of Haskell, Java, Python and MySQL. 
      I enjoy taking part in Hackathons and brainstorming ideas with brilliant individuals.

        I'm a first year computing student. I was selected to be the hall chair for my accommodation this year through which I got to meet and
        interact with students from varied parts of the world. I had the chance to work with and for them to plan loads
        of fun activities to keep everyone connected over the lockdown. I have also been involved in multiple cultural societies which served
        to be a family away from home. I got involved in their subcommittees and have helped in the planning and organisation of events,
        collaborating with other students along the way. I have also taken part in multiple hackathons, forming connections to work on projects
        that can create an impact. This has given the exposure to learn new cultures and widen my horizons which has made me stronger and more independent.
